    <h4>Git/Github terms:</h4>
    <li>Repository: A repository, often referred to as a "repo," is a container for your project. It includes all the project files and their complete history. GitHub allows you to create and store repositories for your code. </li>
    <li>Commit: Developers make changes to the project files and create commits. A commit represents a set of changes (additions, deletions, modifications) to the project at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier, and a commit message that describes the changes made. </li>
    <li>Fork: In GitHub, a "fork" refers to a copy of a repository. When you fork a repository, you create a duplicate of the original repository within your GitHub account.</li>
    <li>Push: In the context of GitHub and Git, "push" refers to the action of uploading or sending your local code changes to a remote repository.</li>
    <li>Pull requests: In GitHub, developers create pull requests to propose changes from one branch to another, typically from a feature branch to the main branch. Pull requests are where code reviews and discussions happen before merging.</li>
    <li>Workflows: In GitHub, "workflows" typically refers to GitHub Actions, which is a powerful and flexible automation and CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) platform provided by GitHub. </li>
    <li>Issues:In GitHub, "issues" refer to a feature that allows users to track, discuss, and manage tasks, bugs, feature requests, and other project-related items within a repository.</li>
    <li>Raw button: The "Raw" button in GitHub is a feature that allows you to view the raw content of a file hosted in a GitHub repository.</li>
    <li>Blame button:The "Blame" button in GitHub is a feature that allows you to view the detailed revision history of a specific file, showing who made each change to the file and when those changes were made. </li>
